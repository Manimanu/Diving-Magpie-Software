THE LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, GOODWILL, DATA OR 
COMPUTER PROGRAMS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO CASE SHALL 
SOLIDPARTNERS'S LIABILITY FOR MONEY DAMAGES EXCEED 
THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OUT OF 
WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE.  The forgoing limitations 
shall not apply to claims relating to death or 
personal injury which arise out of products deemed 
to be consumer goods under applicable law.  Some 
states or localities do not allow the exclusions 
or limitation of implied warranties or limitation 
of liability for incidental or consequential 
damages, so the above exclusion or limitation 
may not apply to you.
