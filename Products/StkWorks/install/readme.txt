        	StickWorks v2.x

------------------------------------------------------------------------

StickWorks *must* be shutdown before SolidWorks
otherwise an error occurs.   

Under Windows NT, this is a Dr Watson error and
another instance of SolidWorks is started.  This
is not visible and must be terminated from the
Task Manager.

Under Windows 95, this is causes an OLE error
and another instance of SolidWorks is started.
This is not visible and must be terminated from
the Windows Close Program (press CTRL-ALT-DEL).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before running the software for the first time,
make sure your joystick is properly calibrated.
This may be done through the Windows control
panel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the program starts, it looks for the file
'StkWorks.ini' in the Windows directory.  If
this is not found, it will assume default settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There may be problems under Windows 95 when the
program tries to load the supplied 'StkWorks.ini'
file.  This usually shows up as lots of error
message boxes advising a floating point exception
has occurred.  Delete the supplied 'StkWorks.ini'
file and the program should start up with default
settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only one instance of the program is allowed.
This is so that only one set of actions is
interpreted from the joystick.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

All actions are disabled if the joystick control
panel is active.  This is to prevent spurious
actions from occurring when testing or calibrating
the joystick.
