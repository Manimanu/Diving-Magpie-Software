		StickWorks v3.x

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very Important!!
Please make sure you have the correct version 
of StickWorks for your operating system.  There
are separate versions for Windows NT and 
Windows 95.  They are not interchangeable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
Several entries have to be made in the registry.
It is highly recommended that this be left to 
the installation program.

For the brave of heart attempting a manual
installation, please read the Manual
Installation section at the end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common Problems:

1) StickWorks doesn't work:
For those people doing a manual installation,
there are separate version of StickWorks for
Windows NT and Windows 95.  They are NOT
interchangeable.  Please make sure you are 
using the correct version.

2) StickWorks still doesn't work:
Make sure that your joystick is working by
calibrating it with the Windows control
panel.

3) StickWorks *STILL* doesn't work:
The registry entries assume the 
'Program Files' directory is on the C drive.
