A huge collection of _SolidWorks_ addins, written in _Borland C++ Builder_ and _Visual Studio C++_

  <summary>SolidWorks addins</summary>

These were written c1996-c2000 and probably do not show the best practices for C++ as I was just
learning C++/COM and fumbling my way through.  However, in my defence,  "Shipping code trumps everything"!

The first addins were developed as out-of-process exe's using _Borland C++ Builder_. The main advantage was
almost _Visual Basic_ like rapid development of user interfaces.

Later addins were done as in-process dll's with _Microsoft Visual C++_.  It was a huge culture shock to
develop user interfaces in _MFC_ after being spoilt with _Borland C++ Builder_'s _VCL_.
