	        PointerWorks v1.1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very Important!!
Please make sure you have the correct version 
of PointerWorks for your operating system.  There
are separate versions for Windows NT and 
Windows 95.  They are not interchangeable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
Several entries have to be made in the registry.
It is highly recommended that this be left to 
the installation program.

For the brave of heart attempting a manual
installation, please read the Manual
Installation section at the end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common Problems:

1) PointerWorks doesn't work:
Make sure that the middle button and/or scrolling
wheel are working.  There is a diagnostic program
available to confirm correct operation.  Please
use this program before contacting technical
support.

2) PointerWorks still doesn't work:
The registry entries assume the 
'Program Files' directory is on the C drive.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual Installation:
1) The following files are required:
    Windows NT:
        PointerWorksNT.reg        registry settings
        PointerWorksNT.dll        PointerWorks

    Windows 95:
        PointerWorks95.reg        registry settings
        PointerWorks95.dll        PointerWorks

3) Place the PointerWorks file in a directory of
your choice.

4) Edit the registry setting file with a
text editor (notepad) to give the full path
to the PointerWorks file.  Don't forget to put in
double backslashes '\\' otherwise it won't work.

5) Double click on the registry settings file
to install it to the Windows registry.
