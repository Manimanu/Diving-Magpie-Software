      Fixing VRML Files Created by SolidWorks 
      How convienient for SolidWorks to include a slick little VRML export 
      function in their software. Well it kind of works. Though I've tried it in 
      the past as a tool to convey information to co-workers it has typically 
      left me un-impressed. The recent availability of e-drawings 
      http://www.solidworks.com/edrawings/ has made VRML rather antiquated. None 
      the less, I have been looking into VRML files lately and thought I would 
      share my findings. This article is only intended to show you how to fix 
      some of the shortcomings of a SolidWorks VRML file. It is not my intention 
      to introduce you to the whole notion of 3D worlds or how to use a VRML 
      viewer. 
      In a nut shell, to make a VRML file from a SolidWorks model you can simply 
      SAVE AS and specify a .wrl file type. 




      After saving the file you will need some special software to view it with. 
      Typically a VRML plug-in is used in conjuction with your web browser. I 
      use Cortona but also feel that Cosmo Player is an excellent product too. 
      If you have no idea what I am talking about I urge you to go to 
      http://www.vrml.org to learn more about getting and setting up the 
      software. 
      When I open the file the first thing I see is nothing. But WAIT! There is 
      a small spec in the center of the screen. What is that?

      Lucky thing I have a FIT button on the bottom right hand side of my viewer.
      Well thats a little better. Things are still looking quite pasty. Thats 
      when I started looking into the actual code that SolidWorks generates for 
      my .wrl file. First off, it is VMRL 1.0 which is dated now. VRML 2.0 
      replaced it with some nifty enhancements. Then VRML 2.0 was adopted as an 
      ISO/IEC standard and renamed to VRML97. Anyway, back to the project at 
      hand. The actual file xxxx.wrl is simply an ASCII file. You can manually 
      edit it and make changes to it with any text editor such as notepad.

      The following is a snippet of top of my file: 
      SolidWorks Output
#VRML V1.0 ascii

Separator { 
   DirectionalLight { direction 0 0 -1 }
   Separator {                 # Object Separator 
      Material { emissiveColor 0.3 0.8 0.2 }
      Material { emissiveColor 0.752941 0.752941 0.752941 }
      Coordinate3
                {
                point [

       *** and a lot of other stuff below here ***




      How to Fix This Mess 
        Comment out the DirectionalLight 
        Search and Replace emissive with diffuse for the entire document 
      Modified .wrl file
#VRML V1.0 ascii

Separator { 
   #DirectionalLight { direction 0 0 -1 }
   Separator {                 # Object Separator 
      Material { diffuseColor 0.3 0.8 0.2 }
      Material { diffuseColor 0.752941 0.752941 0.752941 }
      Coordinate3
                {
                point [

                       -0.097583362	 -0.073422551	 -0.011430000,
                       -0.096528735	 -0.048022552	 -0.011381241,
                       -0.096528735	 -0.073422551	 -0.011381241,
       *** and a lot of other stuff below here ***

      Now when you view the file and FIT it, you will get something that look 
      much more like a 3D model should. TURN ON HEADLIGHT! Because we deleted 
      the Directional Light you will not have ANY light in the model without the 
      head light. Personally I like this as it gives you a sense of depth when 
      viewing the model. If you don't have the headlight turned on then you will 
      just have a black screen. You will not find the model no matter how hard 
      you look. The head light is usually a toggle that is an option with your 
      viewer program. After I open the VRML file I can RIGHT-CLICK on the 
      browser window and toggle the headlight on and off.

      One final word on the quality of your VRML files. The SolidWorks 
      PERFORMANCE settings have everything to do with the quality of your VRML 
      files. Rounded surfaces get faceted. The size of the flats is dictated by 
      the resolution you use in SolidWorks. Use Tools, Options, Performance to 
      adjust the amount of detail in your VRML file. Higher settings will make 
      bigger VRML files too. For the purposes here I used the coarsest settings 
      I could. Using better detail settings looked much nicer when viewing the 
      VRML file, but it was 3 times as big too.
