FindFile version 1.0

Copyright (C) September 1997 Walter Dorawa

Everyone is free to use this code as they wish, but
if you use it commercially then I wouldn't mind a
little something.

OVERVIEW:
=========

This is a little utility component, which allows you to search a directory
for any file or folder.

It wraps the FindFirst/FindNext/FindClose functions, and supplies the
ability to recurse directories.

USAGE:
======

To activate the component use:

FindFile1.Execute;

The list of matched files/folders is returned in the 
Files property (TStrings), and includes the full path and file name.

You can use ExtractFileName to just get the file name then.

The After and Before execute events are there....but not sure how useful
they will be?

If you find this component useful, have any suggestions or found bugs,
please email me: walterd@gte.net

INSTALLATION:
=============
Copy the files into a folder on your computer, select Component|Install
in Delphi, click Add, enter the location of FileFind.pas, click okay.
