Very Important!!
Please make sure you have the correct version 
of PDFWorks for your operating system.  There
are separate versions for Windows NT and 
Windows 95.  They are not interchangeable.

Installation:
Several entries have to be made in the registry.
It is highly recommended that this be left to 
the installation program.

Common Problems:

1) PDFWorks doesn't work:
For those people doing a manual installation,
there are separate version of PDFWorks for
Windows NT and Windows 95.  They are NOT
interchangeable.  Please make sure you are 
using the correct version.

2) PDFWorks still doesn't work:
The registry entries assume the 
'Program Files' directory is on the C drive.
